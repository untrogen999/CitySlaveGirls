# CitySlaveGirls

Site homepage: [https://untrogen999.github.io/CitySlaveGirls/](https://untrogen999.github.io/CitySlaveGirls/)

This repository was created to revive the "CitySlaveGirls" project and website made in the Spring 2016 semester of
HUMAN-1050, taught at PITT Greensburg. The original project was broken up into two repos to separate the code to generate the project website from the website itself. This revival project is based off of the latter repo.

The original repo was hosted on the personal site of a
previous professor teaching HUMAN-1050; however, the website's owner removed the project's code,
taking down the project's website in the process. Thus, the primary goal for this revival project is to change any files and code
that were reliant on the old infrastructure so that the website lives again using Github Pages.

This project keeps changes to the original repo to the minimum, just enough to make the website
visible on the web again with functioning links.

Other than filling this README with, well, text, the most significant change done to the original project
was
inserting the navigation bar and footer in all files. Originally, the project relied on server-side
includes (HTML comments of a particular syntax that tell the hosting
server to insert HTML code from other files) to break up pieces of web pages, such as the navigation
bar, across files and include them into other files as needed. Since we can't do that with Github
Pages, the full HTML is included in the HTML instead.

Lastly, there was a pair of SSIs that seemingly were used to automatically insert a "last modified" date into the footers of every page on the website, which have all been replaced with just the year "2025".

The original project repo, if you're
interested, is hosted also on Github, but it does not use Github Pages:

See below for the original project READMEs, in the same order as the bullet list above.

# The Restoration of Nell Nelson

If you are new to the project please refer to our [Project Basics Wiki](https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls/wiki/Project-Basics) and our [Codebook](https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls/wiki/Checkout-our-Codebook!))!  

This is a public work space for experimenting with the coding and digitization of the "City Slave Girls" series printed in the _Chicago Times_, 1888.  

The original publication in the _Chicago Times_ and was authored by Helen Cusack under the pseudonym Nell Nelson.  
After the original newspaper publication there were two books published within the same year that included edited, abridged versions of the series. (There is also evidence that the series was republished in New York's _World_ newspaper the following year.)
